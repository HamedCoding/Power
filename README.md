# Power Consumption / Keras / LSTM
This dataset contains 8784 records of hourly energy consumption, which retrieved  from  the  smart  metering  device  of a  large hypermarket in 2016 [[1]](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n85kwcgt7t/1).  

Average power consumption (classified in 7 levels) for each hour of each weekday in 2016.
